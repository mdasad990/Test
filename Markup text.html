				<b>Re: Eileen Dover university application</b>
			</p>
			<p>Dear Eileen,<br><br>
					Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science<br> faculty to study as part of your <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in<br> the following sections.<br><br>
				<b>Starting dates</b><br><br>
					We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it<br> would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for<br> each one are as follows:
			</p>
			<ul><li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
				<li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
				<li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
			</ul>
			<p> Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.<br>
			    You can find more information about <a href="important university dates">important university dates</a> on our website.

			<strong>Subjects of study</strong>
	<!--what is defference <b></b> or <strong></strong>-->
			<p>
				At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long <br>as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an<br> intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team.
			</p><br>
				Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
				<li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding<br> 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 ×<br> 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
				<li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long<br> you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you<br> think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>
			<b>Exotic dance moves</b>
			<p>Yes, <i>you are right!</i> As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To<br> answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</P>
			<dl>
				<dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
					<dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village<br> would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be <br>"fruitful".</dd>
				<dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
			    	<dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice <br>this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and <br>shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my <br>fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as<br> Twerking.</dd>
				<dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
				    <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s<br> believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted<br> movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on<br> however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really<br> cold.</dd>
